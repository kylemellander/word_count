# Word Count

##### Simple Web App to search a string for a word , 8/7/2015

#### By Kyle Mellander

## Description

This is a simple web app that allows the user to put in 2 inputs - 1 for a long phrase or paragraph and the other for 1 word.  It then searches the phrase for how many times the word appears, shows that as well as a display of where the words appear.

## Setup

* Clone from git
* In Console, run "ruby app.rb"

OR

* Go directly to https://vast-lake-1308.herokuapp.com/ to test the app

## Notes

If you want to search only for whole words matching whole words (so it would not show positive for cat if the phrase was cathedral), then you can go to the whole word branch.

## Technologies Used

Ruby, Sinatra, HTML, CSS, Capybara, Rspec
